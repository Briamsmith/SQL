# I created the schema below to show skills of selecting data from multiple tables:

CREATE TABLE personal_info (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    stage_name TEXT,
    marriage_status TEXT,
    birthdate TEXT);
    
INSERT into personal_info (id, stage_name, marriage_status, birthdate)
    VALUES ("1", "BeyoncÃ©", "married", "1981-09-04");
INSERT into personal_info (id, stage_name, marriage_status, birthdate)
    VALUES ("2", "Tim McGraw", "married", "1967-05-01");
INSERT into personal_info (id, stage_name, marriage_status, birthdate)
    VALUES ("3", "Carrie Underwood", "married", "1983-03-10");
INSERT into personal_info (id, stage_name, marriage_status, birthdate)
    VALUES ("4", "SZA", "Single", "1989-11-08");
INSERT into personal_info (id, stage_name, marriage_status, birthdate)
    VALUES ("5", "Drake", "single", "1986-10-24");

CREATE TABLE celebrity (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    genre TEXT,
    networth INTEGER,
    album_number INTEGER);

INSERT into celebrity (id, genre, networth, album_number)
    VALUES ("1", "R&B", "355", "10");
INSERT into celebrity (id, genre, networth, album_number)
    VALUES ("2", "country", "200", "16");
INSERT into celebrity (id, genre, networth, album_number)
    VALUES ("3", "country", "140", "10");
INSERT into celebrity (id, genre, networth, album_number)
    VALUES ("4", "R&B", "6", "2");
INSERT into celebrity (id, genre, networth, album_number)
    VALUES ("5", "rap", "150", "8");

# Who is the oldest in the database and how many albums have they sold?
SELECT p.stage_name AS oldest_person, c.album_number AS albums_sold
FROM personal_info AS p
JOIN celebrity AS c ON p.id = c.id
ORDER BY strftime('%Y', p.birthdate) ASC
LIMIT 1;

# Who has an average networth of 200 and over and what is their marriage status?
SELECT p.stage_name, p.marriage_status
FROM personal_info AS p
JOIN celebrity AS c ON p.id = c.id
GROUP BY p.stage_name, p.marriage_status
HAVING AVG(c.networth) >= 200;
